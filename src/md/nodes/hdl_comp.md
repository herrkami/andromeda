# Compiler/transpiler
**Summary from Wikipedia**: 
A silicon compiler is an electronic design automation software tool that is used for high-level synthesis of integrated circuits. Such tool takes a user's specification of an IC design as input and automatically generates an integrated circuit (IC) design files as output for further fabrication by the seminconductor fabrication plant or manually from discrete components. The process is sometimes referred to as hardware compilation. The silicon compiler may use vendor's Process Design Kit for the production.
