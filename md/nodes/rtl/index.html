<h1>RTL - Register transfer level</h1>
<p>Register transfer level or gate level description</p>
<p><strong>Summary from Wikipedia</strong>:
In digital circuit design, register-transfer level (RTL) is a design abstraction which models a synchronous digital circuit in terms of the flow of digital signals (data) between hardware registers, and the logical operations performed on those signals.
Register-transfer-level abstraction is used in hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog and VHDL to create high-level representations of a circuit, from which lower-level representations and ultimately actual wiring can be derived.  Design at the RTL level is typical practice in modern digital design.Unlike in software compiler design, where the register-transfer level is an intermediate representation and at the lowest level, the RTL level is the usual input that circuit designers operate on. In fact, in circuit synthesis, an intermediate language between the input register transfer level representation and the target netlist is sometimes used. Unlike in netlist, constructs such as cells, functions, and multi-bit registers are available. Examples include FIRRTL and RTLIL.
Transaction-level modeling is a higher level of electronic system design.</p>
