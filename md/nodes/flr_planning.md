# Floor planning
**Summary from Wikipedia**: 
In electronic design automation, a floorplan of an integrated circuit is a schematic representation of tentative placement of its major functional blocks.
In modern electronic design process floorplans are created during the floorplanning design stage, an early stage in the hierarchical approach to integrated circuit design.
Depending on the design methodology being followed, the actual definition of a floorplan may differ.
