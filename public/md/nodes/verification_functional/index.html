<h1>Functional verification</h1>
<p><strong>Summary from Wikipedia</strong>:
Functional verification is the task of verifying that the logic design conforms to specification. Functional verification attempts to answer the question &quot;Does this proposed design do what is intended?&quot; This is complex and takes the majority of time and effort (up to 70% of design and development time) in most large electronic system design projects. Functional verification is a part of more encompassing design verification, which, besides functional verification, considers non-functional aspects like timing, layout and power.</p>
