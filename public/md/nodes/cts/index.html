<h1>CTS - Clock tree synthesis</h1>
<p><strong>Summary from Wikipedia</strong>:
In electronics and especially synchronous digital circuits, a clock signal (historically also known as logic beat) is an electronic logic signal (voltage or current) which oscillates between a high and a low state at a constant frequency and is used like a metronome to synchronize actions of digital circuits.  In a synchronous logic circuit, the most common type of digital circuit, the clock signal is applied to all storage devices, flip-flops and latches, and causes them all to change state simultaneously, preventing race conditions.<br>
A clock signal is produced by an electronic oscillator called a clock generator.  The most common clock signal is in the form of a square wave with a 50% duty cycle.   Circuits using the clock signal for synchronization may become active at either the rising edge, falling edge, or, in the case of double data rate, both in the rising and in the falling edges of the clock cycle.</p>
