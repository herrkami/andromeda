<h1>PEX - Parasitic Extraction</h1>
<p><strong>Summary from Wikipedia</strong>:
In electronic design automation, parasitic extraction is the calculation of the parasitic effects in both the designed devices and the required wiring interconnects of an electronic circuit: parasitic capacitances, parasitic resistances and parasitic inductances, commonly called parasitic devices, parasitic components, or simply parasitics.
The major purpose of parasitic extraction is to create an accurate analog model of the circuit, so that detailed simulations can emulate actual digital and analog circuit responses. Digital circuit responses are often used to populate databases for signal delay and loading calculation such as: timing analysis; power analysis; circuit simulation; and signal integrity analysis. Analog circuits are often run in detailed test benches to indicate if the extra extracted parasitics will still allow the designed circuit to function.</p>
